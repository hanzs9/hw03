The first part will also require you to use a search engine to find the right pandas functions to use to analyse your data. Some potentially useful pandas functions are listed in the file `veryUseful.py`. \n",

    "\n",
    "**30% of grade**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, you will develop a clustering algorithm to study the similarity of different stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general purpose of clustering analysis is dividing a set of objects into groups that are somehow \"similar\" to each other. It is a widespread tool used for exploratory data analysis in diverse fields in both science and business. For example, in marketing analytics, cluster analysis is employed to group consumers into segments based on their characteristics or _features_, such as age, post code, purchase history, etc. These features are somehow aggregated to compare the similarity between consumers. Based on this similarity, a clustering algorithm then divides the consumers into segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply this idea on stock market data to identify groups of stocks that perform similarly over time. There are many reasons for grouping stocks together, such as analysing trading strategies, risk management, or simply presenting stock market information. Publicly traded companies are often grouped together by simple features such as the industry they operate in (eg tech companies or pharma companies), but here we'll take a data-driven approach, grouping together stocks that perform similarly over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster analysis is an umbrella term for many different algorithmic approaches. Here you'll develop one that's based on the concept of `greedy` algorithm design, specified below. You'll also have the opportunity to explore other approaches using Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a good measure for stocks \"performing similarly\" to use for clustering. Let's use the one we just calculated: correlations in their returns. How can we use this similarity information for clustering? We now have access to all correlations between stock returns in S&P 500. We can think of this as a _graph_ as follows. The _nodes_ of the graph are the stocks (eg MSFT and AAPL). The _edges_ between them are the correlations, which we have just calculated between each stock, where the value of the correlation is the edge weight. Notice that since we have the correlations between all companies, this is a _dense_ graph, where all possible edges exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus have a graph representing pairwise \"similarity\" scores in correlations, and we want to divide the graph into clusters. There are many possible ways to do this, but here we'll use a _greedy_ algorithm design. The algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort the edges in the graph by their weight (ie the correlation), pick a number $k$ for the number of iterations of the algorithm\n",
    "2. Create single-node sets from each node in the graph\n",
    "3. Repeat $k$ times:\n",
    "\t1. Pick the graph edge with the highest correlation\n",
    "\t2. Combine the two sets containing the source and the destination of the edge\n",
    "\t3. Repeat with the next-highest weight edge\n",
    "4. Return the remaining sets after the $k$ iterations \n",
    "\n",
    "What does the algorithm do? It first initializes a graph with no connections, where each node is in a separate set. Then in the main loop, it runs through the $k$ highest-weighted edges, and adds connections at those edges. This leads to sets being combined (or \"merged\"). The result is \"groups\" of stocks determined by the highest correlations between the stock returns. These are your stock clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that the toy graph below represents four stocks: A,B,C,D and their return correlations. Suppose we pick $k=2$ and run the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cluster0.png\" alt=\"cluster0\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm would begin by initializing four separate sets of one node each: {A}, {B}, {C}, {D}. It would then first connect C and D because of their correlation 0.95, resulting in just three sets: {A}, {B}, and {C,D}. Then it would connect A and B, resulting in two sets of two nodes each: {A,B}, and {C,D}. These would be our clusters for $k=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Implementing the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the clustering algorithm using the functions below. First, for convenience in implementing the algorithm, let's create a list of the correlations from the pandas data. "

One great way is to use a dictionary where each _key_ is a node, and each _value_ is another node that this node \"points to\". A cluster is then a chain of these links, which we represent as a dictionary.\n",

In terms of the dictionary, this means that one of them will not point to itself, but to the other one (here it does not matter which one). So we make the dictionary at `C` point to `D`.

No - that would leave nothing  pointing at `D`, and `C` and `D` should remain connected! We could perhaps have `C` somehow point at both nodes, but that could become complicated, so we'll do the following instead. We'll follow the chain to the bottom. In the dictionary, we look up `C` and see that it points to `D`. We then look up `D` which points to itself, so `D` is the _bottom_ node. We then pick one of the bottom nodes `B` and `D`, and make it point to the other. We then have the dictionary `{'A':'B','B':'B','C':'D','D':'B'}`, and the corresponding clustering in the figure below.\n",

You'll implement this in the function `find_bottom` below. The function takes as input a node and a dictionary, and runs through the \"chain\" in the dictionary until it finds a bottom node pointing to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing we'll need to do is combine clusters by connecting two nodes. This means taking the two nodes, finding the bottom node for each node's cluster, and making one point to the other. You'll implement this in the function `merge_clusters` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll need to set up the algorithm by sorting the correlations, and then looping through this merging $k$ times. You'll implement this in the function `cluster_correlations` below. This completes the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is one more thing. If you only keep track of a dictionary like `{'A':'B','B':'B','C':'D','D':'B'}`, how do you actually find the clusters from the dictionary? A convenient way is to store some extra information: the \"starting nodes\" of each cluster to which no other node links. For example, above these \"starting nodes\" would include all nodes `A,B,C,D` in the beginning, but only `A` and `C` in the end. If we keep track of these, we can then write a function that starts from each such remaining \"starting node\", works through to the bottom, and creates the cluster along the way. You'll implement this in the function `construct_sets` below."

This is not required but being creative and going further than the above questions will make your work stand out. You can explore one or several of the ideas below, or come up with questions of your own.\n",

    "Depending on your interests, you might look at different things. For example, when researching the algorithm, you might be interested in its complexity, and how to improve your implementation's efficiency. On Wikipedia, you may find a couple of ways to drastically improve the algorithm speed, but are relatively small changes to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're more interested in the financial applications of clustering, there are also opportunities to think about further steps. For example, some people claim that you can derive trading strategies based on clustering - that often one of the stocks in a cluster is a leader and the others follow that price. If this is true, you could track the price of the leader stock and then trade the other stocks in the cluster based on changes in the leader's price. Do you think this would make sense? Do you have an idea on how to identify a leader stock?\n",

You would be able to do this by looking at the code for the second homework to figure out how to read data from Yahoo Finance using pandas, and going through the process for all companies in the csv file for another time period. Perhaps you could explore for example how correlations between companies have changed over time, or how clusters found by your algorithm change over time.\n",

    "You've used just one approach to clustering, and arguably not the best one. Research clustering algorithms and libraries to apply them in Python. Discuss some other algorithms that could be used, and how they differ from the one you've implemented. Look at the Python library `scikit-learn`. How would you apply the clustering algorithms provided by the library to stock price data? Would you need to develop new metrics other than correlations? If you want to go even further,  try running some of these other clustering algorithms on your data, and report the results. Start from here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering; you'll find a stock market example there too.
